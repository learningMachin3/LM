<h1 id="title">Is Fear Over Crt Stopping The Conversation About Racism? W/ Jania Hoover</h1>

<p id="info">
2021, Learning Machine Podcast<br>
Series 2<br>

</p>

<p id="summary">
Dr. Jania Hoover is an educator and teacher coach with over 16 years of classroom experience. As an expert on social studies education, Dr. Hoover discussed how teachers can navigate controversial topics in the classroom with their students. In her words, "students will ask you the tough questions" so you should probably prepare to answer them. Dr. Hoover wrote an article in July 2021 on the importance of teaching kids about racism regardless of the current debate around critical race theory. In this episode, we discuss representing diverse authors in the classroom, teaching authentic social studies, and how teachers can facilitate critical reading of controversial texts in the classroom.

<span title="2:46 - 2:57" data-start="00:02:46.337" data-end="00:02:57.411" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">I had the chance to sit down with Janea Hoover and she had some awesome advice for teachers and school districts about how to talk with students about racism and how to be an advocate for equity,</span><br>
<span title="2:58 - 3:06" data-start="00:02:57.592" data-end="00:03:06.316" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Janine and I talked about her own journey to becoming a teacher and how she incorporates discussions about race and racism in her own classroom.</span><br>

<span title="3:09 - 3:18" data-start="00:03:08.865" data-end="00:03:17.608" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">came up for us in our conversation was how can teachers grapple with this tension of teaching students about history in America when</span><br>
<span title="3:18 - 3:24" data-start="00:03:17.506" data-end="00:03:24.109" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">so many of the major figures are tied up in the problematic history of slaveholding</span><br>
<span title="3:24 - 3:31" data-start="00:03:24.098" data-end="00:03:31.440" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">and many of these figures committed what really can only be described as racially motivated atrocities so,</span><br>
<span title="3:32 - 3:40" data-start="00:03:31.609" data-end="00:03:39.829" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">our debate topic for today's episode is
should some historical figures who were racist.</span><br>
<span title="3:40 - 3:50" data-start="00:03:40.238" data-end="00:03:50.207" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Be cancelled from our elementary or secondary Social Studies classrooms like are there any historical figures who are just too problematic for students to be learning about.</span><br>
<span title="3:51 - 4:00" data-start="00:03:50.868" data-end="00:03:59.797" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">And I'll start by saying sort of how I think about this topic because you know I've been thinking about a lot over the last weekend.</span><br>
<span title="4:00 - 4:09" data-start="00:04:00.411" data-end="00:04:09.021" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">In particular in light of the recent sort of conversation around Banning books in in classrooms and.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[4:10]</small> <span title="4:10 - 4:19" data-start="00:04:09.857" data-end="00:04:18.870" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">In my conversation with with doctors you know Hoover I've been thinking about that like students are going to engage with history,</span><br>
<span title="4:19 - 4:29" data-start="00:04:19.057" data-end="00:04:29.272" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">like it's out there they have the internet they're going to find out about Christopher Columbus they're going to find out about Thomas Jefferson and they're going to find out about Hitler,</span><br>
<span title="4:30 - 4:38" data-start="00:04:29.500" data-end="00:04:38.039" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">they're going to find out about these figures who did horrible things in history the question is really like in what frame and with what guidance</span><br>
<span title="4:38 - 4:52" data-start="00:04:37.823" data-end="00:04:52.298" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">are they in countering those topics and I'd much rather students encounter those topics in a classroom setting with a teacher who they trust with a teacher who can help to guide them through understanding the nuance and understanding the</span><br>
<span title="4:52 - 5:00" data-start="00:04:52.203" data-end="00:04:59.972" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">your perspective with which the story is being told to help them gain a fuller understanding of these figures than you know,</span><br>
<span title="5:00 - 5:05" data-start="00:05:00.225" data-end="00:05:04.509" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">the flip side of that would be if they just never heard about them at all and then discovered it on their own.</span><br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[5:06]</small> <span title="5:06 - 5:17" data-start="00:05:06.282" data-end="00:05:16.665" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Yeah it's a great point and you know I think this question rests a lot on the idea of what do we mean by cancelled which is just one of these really charged political terms,</span><br>
<span title="5:17 - 5:19" data-start="00:05:16.882" data-end="00:05:19.105" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">nose idea being canceled do we mean,</span><br>
<span title="5:19 - 5:34" data-start="00:05:19.202" data-end="00:05:33.923" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">just completely washing it from the pages of History if we meet if I cancel we mean wash these historical figures from the pages of History because they committed atrocities against people of color I don't think anybody's advocating for that we don't want to erase,</span><br>
<span title="5:34 - 5:36" data-start="00:05:34.086" data-end="00:05:35.666" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">them from history.</span><br>
<span title="5:36 - 5:51" data-start="00:05:36.087" data-end="00:05:50.947" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Students need to learn about the history the good parts of History the bad parts of History they need to learn about the facts and I think draw their own judgments from the facts presented accurately from the honest truth being shared with them.</span><br>
<span title="5:52 - 6:00" data-start="00:05:51.596" data-end="00:06:00.261" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">So I think of you know I figure like Andrew Jackson who is hugely problematic in this treatment of indigenous peoples is horrific.</span><br>
<span title="6:01 - 6:15" data-start="00:06:01.079" data-end="00:06:14.581" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Should he be canceled for what he did does that mean should we criticize what he did definitely if that's what you mean yes if we mean should we wash them from the pages of history no because we need to know what he did,</span><br>
<span title="6:15 - 6:23" data-start="00:06:14.852" data-end="00:06:23.258" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">and how he participated in the problems so we can learn from that and and I'll just say one more thing I think you know students.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:24]</small> <span title="6:24 - 6:30" data-start="00:06:24.160" data-end="00:06:29.754" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Should get the information should get all sides of a story and be encouraged to draw their own ideas,</span><br>
<span title="6:30 - 6:42" data-start="00:06:30.060" data-end="00:06:41.814" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">from that I think that students will bring up these questions you know we said in the intro students are going to want to ask about racism about the mistreatment of all different kinds of communities throughout history.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:43]</small> <span title="6:43 - 6:52" data-start="00:06:42.884" data-end="00:06:52.354" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">And the history classroom is a place to have those conversations so I wouldn't say don't remove anything provide the place to have difficult discussions.</span><br>

<span title="7:02 - 7:14" data-start="00:07:02.239" data-end="00:07:14.239" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">But there is another layer of complexity here that I just learned today like even at my age so I'm going to talk about Tick Tock but it's going to be relevant I was looking,</span><br>
<span title="7:14 - 7:21" data-start="00:07:14.335" data-end="00:07:20.710" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">um at Tic Toc for some funny videos to like spam my husband's dm with so we could,</span><br>
