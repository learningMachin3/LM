<p id="summary">
Should teachers be required to study Critical Race Theory as part of their training? At this point, the teaching workforce is still predominantly white and female and does not reflect the diversity of students in classrooms. Preparing teachers to understand the historical and cultural experiences students bring to the classroom is one solution to mismatched identities. Dr. Amy Samuels is an expert in teacher education and culturally responsive pedagogy and in this episode, she offers her perspective, wisdom, and a few tips for preparing the next generation of educators.

<span title="0:30 - 0:34" data-start="00:00:29.943" data-end="00:00:33.782" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">Pennsylvania that's really not the best career aspiration</span><br>
<span title="0:34 - 0:42" data-start="00:00:33.681" data-end="00:00:41.582" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">but I do remember I was probably in second or third grade and for a Christmas gift I received a chalkboard and I remember in</span><br>
<span title="0:41 - 0:52" data-start="00:00:41.486" data-end="00:00:52.200" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">being in my parents basement and teaching to pretend students in pretend classrooms so it was definitely something that I always was drawn to an interested in and.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[0:52]</small> <span title="0:52 - 1:01" data-start="00:00:52.483" data-end="00:01:01.057" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">Kind of as Nelson Mandela says education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world and I truly believe those sentiments,</span><br>
<span title="1:01 - 1:03" data-start="00:01:01.166" data-end="00:01:03.371" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">throughout my work and education I've,</span><br>
<span title="1:03 - 1:13" data-start="00:01:03.443" data-end="00:01:13.172" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">been in education for 20 years now this is my 20th year and I have found that experiences change people not just students but teachers and Educators as well,</span><br>
<span title="1:13 - 1:25" data-start="00:01:13.370" data-end="00:01:24.517" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">so I've worked in Baltimore city schools I was in Hillsborough County which is in Tampa Florida and now I'm at the University of Montevallo and I can say that I have grown tremendously.</span><br>
<span title="1:25 - 1:32" data-start="00:01:24.776" data-end="00:01:31.571" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">As I've had the opportunity to engage with and learn from hundreds probably at this point thousands of students,</span><br>
<span title="1:32 - 1:45" data-start="00:01:31.674" data-end="00:01:44.665" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">and whether it's a 7th grader and a social studies course that's what I taught when I was in a middle and high school teacher or now when I'm working with Master students or education specialist students who have Decades of experience,</span><br>
<span title="1:45 - 1:52" data-start="00:01:44.732" data-end="00:01:52.165" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">I really believe that everyone has something to bring to the table and we can all learn from one another if we're open to it,</span><br>
<span title="1:52 - 1:58" data-start="00:01:52.357" data-end="00:01:57.717" data-spk="1" data-label="Amy Samuels">so what really draws me to the work and education is the people.</span><br>

<span title="2:44 - 2:46" data-start="00:02:44.366" data-end="00:02:46.469" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Did you talk about critical race Theory.</span><br>
<br>
<b data-spk="4">Rdb:</b><br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[2:48]</small> <span title="2:48 - 2:54" data-start="00:02:47.515" data-end="00:02:54.034" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">I went through a traditional University teacher prep program at Princeton and we.</span><br>
<span title="2:54 - 2:58" data-start="00:02:54.353" data-end="00:02:58.090" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Definitely learned about culturally responsive teaching</span><br>
<span title="2:58 - 3:11" data-start="00:02:57.994" data-end="00:03:11.154" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">and culturally responsive learning I learned about critical race Theory and some of my other classes like sociology and African American literature but my teacher prep program never taught me to teach critical race Theory to students.</span><br>
<br>
<b data-spk="3">Sss:</b><br>
<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[3:13]</small> <span title="3:13 - 3:22" data-start="00:03:12.801" data-end="00:03:22.036" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Yeah such an important Point since I think that's part of the political discussion these days I went through a teacher prep program at cu-boulder in Colorado.</span><br>
<span title="3:22 - 3:24" data-start="00:03:22.457" data-end="00:03:23.653" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">And.</span><br>
<span title="3:24 - 3:39" data-start="00:03:24.278" data-end="00:03:39.078" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Similarly we talked about culturally responsive teaching methods but we didn't address critically critical race theory in our classes and the discussions around race although they came up were not as big of a focus as I wonder that they might be,</span><br>
<span title="3:39 - 3:41" data-start="00:03:39.253" data-end="00:03:41.001" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">teacher prep programs today.</span><br>

<span title="3:47 - 3:57" data-start="00:03:46.794" data-end="00:03:57.430" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">didn't come like critical race Theory didn't come up in any of the classes or any of the course work that we were doing I would through the New York City teaching fellows which is an alternative certification program which meant that</span><br>
<span title="3:57 - 4:07" data-start="00:03:57.328" data-end="00:04:06.660" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">all of us were teaching full time at the same time as taking our classes at night and what I thought was interesting is I remember there was one class we had,</span><br>
<span title="4:07 - 4:15" data-start="00:04:06.750" data-end="00:04:15.253" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">about race racism in education talking about implicit bias but it was never something that was like.</span><br>
<span title="4:16 - 4:28" data-start="00:04:15.938" data-end="00:04:28.070" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Intended to be or like used as a lens through which to view curriculum or pedagogy or other classes it was more like here's the class once you finished that you know about race and then you're good to go.</span><br>
<span title="4:29 - 4:38" data-start="00:04:28.641" data-end="00:04:38.261" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">You know I think that today people are talking more about using it as a lens which seems to be where things are going especially based on what I heard and,</span><br>
<span title="4:38 - 4:43" data-start="00:04:38.400" data-end="00:04:43.075" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">my conversation with dr. Samuels so for today's episode we have a debate topic.</span><br>
<span title="4:43 - 4:53" data-start="00:04:43.454" data-end="00:04:53.176" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">And since you both have personal experience with this matter I wanted to ask you to weigh in on this topic which is should teachers be required to study critical race Theory,</span><br>
<span title="4:53 - 5:01" data-start="00:04:53.302" data-end="00:05:00.651" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">before entering the classroom and before you give your opinion remember we'd also love to hear from our listeners so,</span><br>
<span title="5:01 - 5:10" data-start="00:05:00.796" data-end="00:05:10.067" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">if you're listening to this and you have an opinion on this debate topic remember you can join the conversation on Reddit and Twitter simply go to learning machine podcast.com to find out more.</span><br>

<span title="5:18 - 5:31" data-start="00:05:17.501" data-end="00:05:31.267" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Folks who are entering the teaching World need to be exposed to questions of race and questions of two innocent think critically about race in their work and in the broader culture.</span><br>
<span title="5:32 - 5:39" data-start="00:05:31.514" data-end="00:05:39.013" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">And I also think that in some ways that's exactly what critical race Theory calls on people to do.</span><br>
<span title="5:39 - 5:48" data-start="00:05:39.254" data-end="00:05:48.183" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">I also want to just take the technical stance that critical race theory is an aspect of legal scholarship part of critical studies.</span><br>
<span title="5:48 - 5:58" data-start="00:05:48.430" data-end="00:05:58.416" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">And something that is a specific and sort of Deep dive that shouldn't necessarily be required of all teachers</span><br>
<span title="5:58 - 6:10" data-start="00:05:58.279" data-end="00:06:09.653" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">um and I worry that sometimes when we talk about critical race Theory capital c r t as this this way of thinking that we get a little off track from thinking about the idea that,</span><br>
<span title="6:10 - 6:19" data-start="00:06:09.858" data-end="00:06:18.901" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">definitely folks who want to become teachers need to be considerate of questions around race as they enter the classroom and think about their styles of teacher.</span><br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[6:19]</small> <span title="6:19 - 6:24" data-start="00:06:19.346" data-end="00:06:23.744" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">The problem is that critical race Theory.</span><br>
<span title="6:24 - 6:32" data-start="00:06:24.142" data-end="00:06:31.520" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Is such a complicated sort of topic and so I believe that teachers need to.</span><br>
<span title="6:32 - 6:46" data-start="00:06:31.827" data-end="00:06:45.678" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Learn how to do the work of critical race Theory like definitely learn how to deal with their biases and learn how to like have uncomfortable discussions with their students and with each other and I do believe also that.</span><br>
<span title="6:46 - 6:56" data-start="00:06:46.339" data-end="00:06:56.488" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Teacher prep programs whether traditional or alternative or anything in between definitely should be framed with that work in mind and with that lens but it is.</span><br>
<span title="6:57 - 7:06" data-start="00:06:56.921" data-end="00:07:05.892" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Difficult to ask people especially if you're going through an undergraduate traditional teacher prep program to like.</span><br>
<span title="7:07 - 7:16" data-start="00:07:06.511" data-end="00:07:16.408" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Be able to comprehend what critical race theory is because it's a graduate-level legal studies thing like you said so.</span><br>
<span title="7:17 - 7:30" data-start="00:07:16.811" data-end="00:07:30.475" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">I don't know I feel like I'm in the middle of the road I'll on that one like obviously is critical race theory is important to how we look at the world I wonder if there is a way for people to teach teachers.</span><br>
<span title="7:31 - 7:37" data-start="00:07:31.155" data-end="00:07:36.935" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">With the framework of critical race Theory but in a way that's more
that's.</span><br>
