<h1 id="title">What Is Quantcrit?</h1>
<h4 id="subtitle">How do numbers and data reinforce inequality?</h4>

<p id="info">
2022, Learning Machine Podcast<br>
Series 2<br>
<a href="https://www.learningmachinepodcast.com" target="_blank">https://www.learningmachinepodcast.com</a>
</p>

<p id="summary">
How do our biases shape the way that we think about numbers? Is data an unbiased source of truth? Dr. Wendy Castillo joins us on this episode to talk about these issues and the work she is doing to promote #Data4SocialJustice. We discuss the tenets of Quantitative Critical Race Theory (QuantCrit) and spend some time investigating our own biases about education.

Homework: Write your own positionality statement acknowledging the personal biases you carry with you and how those might impact your production and consumption of data.

<span title="2:08 - 2:23" data-start="00:02:08.498" data-end="00:02:22.534" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">On today's episode we're going to dig deeper into this idea and spend some time looking at how we as podcast hosts can apply the tenants of quantcrit to our work.</span><br>
<span title="2:24 - 2:25" data-start="00:02:23.622" data-end="00:02:24.614" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Stay with us.</span><br>

<span title="2:42 - 2:51" data-start="00:02:41.986" data-end="00:02:50.615" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">And one way to do this is that many quantcrit researchers write a position ality statement at the beginning of their work.</span><br>
<span title="2:51 - 2:59" data-start="00:02:51.306" data-end="00:02:58.931" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">The idea of a positionality statement is that it is an acknowledgement of the biases that you might be bringing to your work.</span><br>
<span title="2:59 - 3:07" data-start="00:02:59.467" data-end="00:03:07.260" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">So I thought it would be interesting for us as both podcast hosts and education professionals to engage in this practice.</span><br>
<span title="3:08 - 3:12" data-start="00:03:08.036" data-end="00:03:12.432" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">So my topic for us to discuss today is how do you think,</span><br>
<span title="3:13 - 3:19" data-start="00:03:12.725" data-end="00:03:19.086" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">your positionality impacts your opinions as an educator and as a podcaster.</span><br>
<span title="3:20 - 3:24" data-start="00:03:19.501" data-end="00:03:23.875" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Or in other words what biases are you bringing to the work that you did.</span><br>
<br>

<span title="3:38 - 3:42" data-start="00:03:38.381" data-end="00:03:42.257" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Both of my parents have advanced degrees.</span><br>
<span title="3:43 - 3:50" data-start="00:03:42.924" data-end="00:03:49.546" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">And they were both practicing lawyers so I really look at education.</span><br>
<span title="3:50 - 4:00" data-start="00:03:50.105" data-end="00:03:59.617" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">From a very young age of age I've looked at it as like indisputably a good thing and and something that I will.</span><br>
<span title="4:00 - 4:09" data-start="00:04:00.014" data-end="00:04:09.183" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">Go through and and you know it was a given that I would attend college and it was a given that I would probably continue to even pursue school after,</span><br>
<span title="4:09 - 4:17" data-start="00:04:09.484" data-end="00:04:16.514" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">you know a four-year degree and I hadn't really thought about the fact that that probably impacts.</span><br>
<span title="4:17 - 4:26" data-start="00:04:16.869" data-end="00:04:25.672" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">How I asked questions and who I talk to about education and really impacts the way that I'm understanding.</span><br>
<span title="4:26 - 4:32" data-start="00:04:26.165" data-end="00:04:32.288" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">How even my students think about whether or not they want to pursue a college degree.</span><br>

<span title="4:56 - 5:09" data-start="00:04:55.700" data-end="00:05:08.914" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">A bit of a classist perspective for that at least I'll speak for myself not for you Nathan with that statement but but the other thing that I think I just have to say is I think a lot and I did as a teacher I thought a lot about the idea that.</span><br>
<span title="5:10 - 5:20" data-start="00:05:09.653" data-end="00:05:20.355" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">You know I wanted to work in inner-city schools and I couldn't get away from the idea that hey you're a white guy who went to mostly white schools you had a.</span><br>
