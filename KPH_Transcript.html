<p id="summary">
Dr. Kathryn Paige Harden recently published her first book, The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality where she makes an urgent case for acknowledging people's individual genetic differences as a necessary precursor to achieving social equality. Dr. Harden compares genetic differences to socioeconomic inequality and argues that her research is an anti-eugenic reclaiming of genetics. In this episode we discuss the implications of Harden's work for teachers, researchers, and policy makers in the field of education where inequality is still very much an unsolved challenge.

<span title="0:41 - 0:46" data-start="00:00:41.240" data-end="00:00:45.710" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">The the variable for student income got deleted.</span><br>
<span title="0:46 - 0:53" data-start="00:00:46.119" data-end="00:00:52.807" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">You just didn't know you were trying to do education research in America and you never knew,</span><br>
<span title="0:53 - 1:08" data-start="00:00:53.102" data-end="00:01:07.962" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">whether students came from low-income are high income families right and you tried to do all of your research on like how to improve schools and which teachers and like like the whole landscape or you were trying to consume research.</span><br>
<span title="1:09 - 1:18" data-start="00:01:08.792" data-end="00:01:18.111" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">And the whole time it was a complete mystery
whether kids came from Rich families or poor families.</span><br>
<span title="1:19 - 1:32" data-start="00:01:18.995" data-end="00:01:32.479" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">That is so hard to imagine and that is the exact situation that education researches in with regards to genetics even though genetics is just as strongly related to how kids doing school social class,</span><br>
<span title="1:33 - 1:36" data-start="00:01:32.786" data-end="00:01:35.568" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">that's you know that is.</span><br>
<span title="1:37 - 1:51" data-start="00:01:36.680" data-end="00:01:50.704" data-spk="1" data-label="Guest">I want us to make that information more visible at the research level which sounds very dry and boring until you think about how hard your job would be if SES information disappeared.</span><br>

<span title="2:17 - 2:29" data-start="00:02:17.097" data-end="00:02:29.222" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">She recently published her first book the genetic Lottery where she makes an urgent case for developing an egalitarian anti Eugenics that acknowledges the reality of genetic differences between people.</span><br>

Hardin during our interview and I'll save her take until after we've had a chance to discuss but.</span><br>
<span title="3:01 - 3:10" data-start="00:03:01.371" data-end="00:03:09.748" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">The question came up when we were talking about how teachers are already implicitly aware of vast amounts of information about their students,</span><br>
<span title="3:10 - 3:16" data-start="00:03:10.000" data-end="00:03:16.496" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">in generally we assume that access to information helps teachers to be more Catholic culturally responsive,</span><br>
<span title="3:17 - 3:27" data-start="00:03:16.550" data-end="00:03:26.519" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">so the question that I wanted to pose for today's episode is should teachers also be privy to genetic information about their students.</span><br>
<span title="3:27 - 3:31" data-start="00:03:27.481" data-end="00:03:31.314" data-spk="2" data-label="NAL">And I'll turn to you Sam first because I'm curious to hear your thoughts.</span><br>

<span title="3:44 - 3:58" data-start="00:03:44.288" data-end="00:03:58.427" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">I know that thinking about serving students in my classroom I always wanted to know what's your language background your cultural background how can I make sure that I know enough to create a classroom environment that is,</span><br>
<span title="3:59 - 4:05" data-start="00:03:58.728" data-end="00:04:05.025" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">comfortable and supportive
to those students and the information helps you.</span><br>
<span title="4:06 - 4:09" data-start="00:04:05.644" data-end="00:04:09.123" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">At the same time I'm keenly aware that</span><br>
<span title="4:09 - 4:21" data-start="00:04:09.034" data-end="00:04:20.619" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">the idea of someone like a teacher having access to genetic information about students feels problematic that feels like a gigantic minefield</span><br>
<span title="4:20 - 4:26" data-start="00:04:20.487" data-end="00:04:26.087" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">of legal and scientific problems many of which feel way above my pay grade but.</span><br>
<span title="4:26 - 4:31" data-start="00:04:26.478" data-end="00:04:30.786" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">For the sake of the argument I guess I would say allowing for.</span><br>
<br>

<small style="opacity: 0.5;">[4:32]</small> <span title="4:32 - 4:46" data-start="00:04:31.970" data-end="00:04:46.043" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Parents and students together to make a decision about what information is shared along with you know support and expertise from the school school district educational experts to say what genetic information is actually relevant.</span><br>
<span title="4:47 - 4:57" data-start="00:04:46.614" data-end="00:04:57.124" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">How that genetic information should be shared you know I don't think that the you know a student's genome should be shared directly with a teacher.</span><br>
<span title="4:58 - 5:03" data-start="00:04:58.140" data-end="00:05:02.688" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">But a teacher knowing this student may.</span><br>
<span title="5:04 - 5:13" data-start="00:05:03.518" data-end="00:05:13.426" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Right and we have to remember that this stuff is probabilities it's not definitive anything this student may need more support or help in,</span><br>
<span title="5:14 - 5:24" data-start="00:05:13.751" data-end="00:05:23.504" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">math or may need some kinda mean if there is if there is an ability to give some kind of targeted support and know more about the student to serve them better.</span><br>
<span title="5:24 - 5:26" data-start="00:05:23.907" data-end="00:05:26.304" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">And we communicate that information carefully.</span><br>
<span title="5:27 - 5:36" data-start="00:05:26.719" data-end="00:05:35.858" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">And we check in with the family the to make sure this is okay and give them the right of refusal then yes under all those conditions I do think that.</span><br>
<span title="5:36 - 5:43" data-start="00:05:36.472" data-end="00:05:43.309" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">Maybe we should we should have teachers you know knowing genetic information about that suit their students that makes sense.</span><br>
<span title="5:44 - 5:49" data-start="00:05:43.983" data-end="00:05:48.748" data-spk="3" data-label="SSS">With a lot of context Raven I don't know what do you what do you think about this.</span><br>

<span title="5:54 - 6:02" data-start="00:05:53.904" data-end="00:06:01.733" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Teachers to use student information like in order to get to know the students better so that they can offer more support.</span><br>
<span title="6:02 - 6:06" data-start="00:06:02.148" data-end="00:06:06.084" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">And I feel like a lot of teachers do that I also feel like a lot of teachers.</span><br>
<span title="6:07 - 6:14" data-start="00:06:06.643" data-end="00:06:14.400" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Um take that information and go ahead and make genetic assumptions about those students based on that so.</span><br>
<span title="6:15 - 6:26" data-start="00:06:15.032" data-end="00:06:25.794" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">When you like you know you already get a list when you get your roster you are able to a lot of times able to see your kids pictures you're able to see even there like.</span><br>
<span title="6:26 - 6:30" data-start="00:06:26.485" data-end="00:06:30.000" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Guardian contact information like if it's their parents,</span><br>
<span title="6:30 - 6:43" data-start="00:06:30.367" data-end="00:06:42.703" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">or if the parents are together you can see from the contact information in the mailing addresses and everything and especially if you live in that Community you know where the students live and where they work even and.</span><br>

<span title="6:56 - 7:06" data-start="00:06:55.617" data-end="00:07:05.934" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Assuming that for instance bullies are less mature than girls and they already decide like we're not going to hold them to the same kind of standard.</span><br>
<span title="7:06 - 7:16" data-start="00:07:06.331" data-end="00:07:15.999" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Or push them as hard necessarily likewise they might assume that white boys automatically are going to have behavior problems or.</span><br>

<span title="7:36 - 7:46" data-start="00:07:36.184" data-end="00:07:45.576" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">in certain subjects the same as other students and so that's what I'm afraid of I'm afraid of giving that genetic information to people who are.</span><br>
<span title="7:46 - 7:50" data-start="00:07:46.051" data-end="00:07:49.572" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">Um a lot of times going to just use that too.</span><br>
<span title="7:51 - 8:03" data-start="00:07:50.516" data-end="00:08:03.153" data-spk="4" data-label="RDB">To justify their their own assumptions that they already make and I'm also not sure like even if a lot of teachers want to do they want to do well with that information and want to support students.</span><br>
