								<h2> About Learning Machine </h2>
								<h4><p>Learning Machine is a podcast aimed at understanding the American education system by
									interviewing the researchers and policymakers who are tackling the data that might enlighten
									us. Each week, we’ll bring you an interview with someone who is actively engaged in this work,
									and we’ll link to their research so that you can start to understand this system with us.</p>
									<p>We are calling on educators of all stripes, academics in the field, policymakers, concerned
										parents, curious students - join us, be a part of this conversation: help us to understand
										this learning machine.</p>

								<h2>Learning Machine is a two human team:</h2>
								<div class="image_and_text">
								<img src="images/Nathan_Oval.png" class="profile">
								<p class="bio"> Nathan is a former computer science teacher and current learning analytics Ph.D.
									candidate. He began his journey as an educator 10 years ago when he became a teacher at a school called The Edge in Taiwan.
									After teaching in Taiwan for 2 years he became a traveling Alpaca for the World Scholars Cup academic competition.
									Finally he landed back in the United States where he taught computer science in a high school in Brooklyn, NY for 4 years
									before entering a learning analytics Ph.D. program in which he is currently in his 3rd year. A bit of a learning machine himself, Nathan enjoys computer programming,
									dendrology, drinking water with chia seeds in it, and walking his awesome Korean Jindo, BboBbo</p>
									<img src="images/Sam_Oval.png" class="profile">
								<p class="bio">Sam is a former middle and high school science teacher in Boston and Denver, as well as a
									former National Park ranger. Sam and Nathan actually began teaching together in the same school in Taiwan, although there friendsdhip goes back much further.
									They were previously in a funk-rock band together in high school in which they recorded a three album LP that has been lost to the sands of time*
									Sam is a science-minded creative who likes climbing mountains, playing
									his guitar, and dancing to LCD Sound System alone on a beach in the moonlight.  <br>*it's not lost, it will surface at some point in this podcast</p>
									<img src="images/BboBbo.png" class="profile">
								<p class="bio">BboBbo is a multi-talented sound engineer. BboBbo was homeschooled for most of her life and her educational philosophy
								can broadly be categorized as behaviorist. Her interests include chipmunks, bully sticks, tennis balls(the miniature kind), and judging people ... from a comfortable distance.</p>
